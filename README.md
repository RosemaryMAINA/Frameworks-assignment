# CORD-19 Dataset Exploration

This project explores the CORD-19 research dataset to practice data cleaning, visualization, and building a simple Streamlit app.

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`metadata.csv`).
- Explored missing values and duplicates.
- Analyzed number of papers per year and top journals.
- Created a word cloud of paper titles.
- Built a simple Streamlit app to display the results.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run app.py

## Files in This Project
1. notebooks/cord19_exploration.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with analysis
2. metadata_cleaned.csv – cleaned dataset
3. app.py – Streamlit app
4. README.md – this file
5. .gitignore – ignores unnecessary files (like virtual environments, cache, etc.)

## Tools Used
1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
